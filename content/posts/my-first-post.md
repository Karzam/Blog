Welcome to my new site! I've been working on this one for a while, step by step, taking my time (maybe too much).
This post has been made to "inaugurate" this place, and to explain why I intended to make it.

### Why this

I used to write some articles in my free time, about life subjects, and also about code. I wrote a tutorial 2 years ago, in 2 parts,
about learning to code a little game using Javascript, and I posted these two on Medium. It was a very nice place to share articles,
and make theme as visible as possible, without much effort.

This was a great success, I got thousand of views, and lot of comments. I even got published in a Medium publication, Hackernoon.
But after that, well, I disapparead for quite a long time, not posting anything during these 2 years, because I landed in a new job, and I used
my precious free time to do something else than coding (making a tutorial is soooo long, I couldn't have imagined it would take so many hours).

Even if Medium is a good place to share content, I wanted to (re)have my own personal website, to gather everything, and to publish a more "personal content" (I really don't like the "how to be successful" articles trend that pop everyday on Medium, but that's another subject...)


### The content

II really like writing tutorials and code-related articles, and I have some plans in mind, like probably republishing my first game-making tutorial (I learned a lot since then and the code quality is going to be way better), and of course create new ones.

I also want to write about slightly different subjects that I can't tell for the moment but it's coming very soon. I've been working in startups for more than 2 years, and I feel more comfortable talking
about what I like / don't like about them, and more generally on the tech world.

Thanks for reading this!
